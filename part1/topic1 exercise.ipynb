    "1. [15 marks] Obtain the code and dataset (under Topic 1 on Learn Ultra) and load the ``citation_graph``.  Two vertices $u$ and $v$ are *connected* in this graph if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ or from $v$ to $u$ (or both).  A *connected component* of the graph is a maximal set of vertices such that each pair of vertices is connected.  How many vertices are there in the largest connected component of the ``citation_graph``?  Let $G$ be the graph formed by the largest connected component of the ``citation_graph`` (that is, obtain $G$ by removing all vertices not in the largest connected component).  Create two plots showing the normalized distributions of the in-degree and out-degree of $G$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. [15 marks] Recall the PA graph model that constructed graphs one vertex at a time.  In this model the out-degrees were all (almost) the same.  Define a version of the model where the out-degree varies in a way that is similar to the distribution found for $G$ in Question 1.  Construct instances of the model and plot the normalized distributions of the in-degree and out-degree and compare them to those of $G$.  (Your model might turn out to be a poor model for $G$.  This does not matter as long as you can motivate your definition and implement it correctly.)"

    "PA Graphs are defined algorithmically: first a complete directed graph on $m$ nodes is created (in a complete graph every node is joined to every other node in both directions).  Then new nodes are added one at a time and each links to $m$ existing nodes.  The probability that the new node links to an old node is proportional to the in-degree of the old node.  The total number of nodes is $n$, where $n$ is generally much larger than $m$.  Duplicate links are eliminated so a new node might be connected to fewer than $m$ nodes.\n",
